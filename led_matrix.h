/*
 * led_matrix.h
 *
 * This file contains declarations of convenient functions for activating
 * the LED matrix on the Raspberry Pi Sense HAT (astropi).
 *
 * The details of opening the framebuffer device and mapping it into memory
 * are hidden in the functions open_led_matrix() and close_led_matrix(),
 * which should be called at the beginning and end of the program using this
 * functionality, respectively.
 *
 * The Sense HAT LED matrix uses the 16-bit RGB565 encoding of colors.
 * In RGB565, the 5 most significant bits encode the red channel, the next
 * 6 bits the green channel and the last 5 bits the blue channel.
 * The function make_rgb565_color() is a convenient way of converting RGB
 * colors in the more common range 0-255 per channel to the RG565 format.
 * Some RGB565 colors are also predefined here.
